<h1 style="margin-left: 150px">About</h1>

  <br>

<p style="margin-left: 150px">Hello readers. My name is Patrick Johnston, I’m a graduate student of journalism at Northeastern University. This website will act as my final project for my Digital History course taken in the fall semester of 2017.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 150px">This website is an attempt to blend my skills as a journalist and apply them in a way that is useful to my study of Digital History. I’ve written this article in a style I would normally use when pursuing a journalism project; making use of quotes from sources to shed light on, what I view as, an important societal issue that not enough people know about.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 150px">However, due to the nature of the class (and time constraints), none of the material presented here is my own original reporting. My sources include self-reported stories of ex-prisoners online, specifically testimony found on Reddit, and YouTube, as well as material produced by <a href="https://joannedecaro.journoportfolio.com/">Joanne DeCaro</a>, creator of the <a href="http://angelenosincarcerated.org/">Angelenos Incarcerated Project</a>. Seriously check out her work, she’s really awesome.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 150px">Of course, with this must come the caveat that some of these stories are self-reported without the filter of an investigative process, so I cannot in good conscious report that every aspect of these testimonies is a verifiable fact. However, I have examined said accounts and the subsequent comments/online discussions that followed for any inconsistencies or dubious sounding claims, and I can find no reason to disbelieve the material I have used in this piece.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 150px">I hope you enjoy my project.</p>
